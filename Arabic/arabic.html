                <p id="didYouKnow"> <strong> There are at least 11 words for 'love'‚ù§Ô∏è and hundreds of words for 'camel'üê™ <br><br></strong> Arabic has at least 11 words for love and each of them conveys a different stage in the process of falling in love. The word 'hawa', for example, describes the initial attraction or inclining of the soul or mind towards another. The term comes from the root word ‚Äòh-w-a‚Äô - a transient wind that can rise and fall. </p>

            <p class="paragraph">Arabic is the language of the Qur æƒÅn (or Koran, the sacred book of Islam) and the religious language of all Muslims. Literary Arabic, usually called Classical Arabic, is essentially the form of the language found in the Qur æƒÅn, with some modifications necessary for its use in modern times; it is uniform throughout the Arab world. Colloquial Arabic includes numerous spoken dialects, some of which are mutually unintelligible. The chief dialect groups are those of Arabia, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and North Africa. With the exception of the dialect of Algeria, all Arabic dialects have been strongly influenced by the literary language.
