                writing to each other in English. But in fact, only 20% of the world’s population speak some degree of
                English, and it is the native tongue of just 330 million (less than 5%) of us. Translation is still a
                big deal..</p>

            <p id="didYouKnow"> There is a language that is far easier than English to translate. According to most
                translators with years of experience, Spanish is the easiest language to translate. It is because, in
                the Spanish language, words written are identical to the way they sound, which makes it the most
                accessible language to learn and translate.</p>

        <h1 id="headingTwo"> Why to study Translation?</h1>
        <div id="thirdParagraph">
            <p class="paragraph">Translating at a professional level requires more than just a knowledge of multiple
                languages. Studying translation is a great way to learn the technical skills and nuances of the work,
                including specific technology, terminology, and industry norms and etiquette.

                <br> More and more translation vacancies may be coming up, but competition for these jobs is also on the
                rise. Increasing numbers of translators come to the trade with a degree in translation on their resume
                to impress employers and increase their market value. College provides opportunities for you to complete
                professional-style assignments and receive personal feedback and guidance. Your teachers will be
                experienced professionals, and your classmates will form the basis of your extended international
                network..</p>

            <p class="paragraph4">A copywriter creates text to describe products or services for the information of
                consumers and businesses. A translator-copywriter takes that text and converts it to the appropriate
                language -- for example, for a website that has different language options, or for a product that is
                being distributed outside of its native country.</p>
            <p class="head_"><strong>Cultural advisor</strong></p>
            <p class="paragraph4">A cultural advisor may work for the government, an NGO, the UN, or any organization
                that deals with multiple languages when developing policy or planning international strategy. They
                research and collate relevant documents and sources, and may translate them, create a summary in the
                local language, or both. </p>
            <p class="head_"><strong>UN (or other such organizations)</strong></p>
            <p class="paragraph4">Content for translation includes reports and statements from member governments, so
                accuracy and fidelity are of utmost importance. Translators use the eLUNa computer-assisted translation
                tool to compare texts and terminology with previous UN documents, databases, and other resources</p>
            <p class="head_"><strong>Event coordinator</strong></p>
            <p class="paragraph4"> An event coordinator plans, organizes, and promotes meetings and events. Companies
                and organizations with international interests often require their event coordinator to be bilingual so
                that they can closely manage events in different countries or with foreign guests or foreign
                contractors. Close attention to detail is a must, and sociability is a distinct advantage, too.</p>
            <p class="head_"><strong>Tour guide</strong></p>
            <p class="paragraph4">The qualification requirements to be a tour guide are generally less demanding than
                for other jobs in this article. This makes it a great role to gain experience and build confidence in

            <h1>Why to learn English language</h1>
            <p class="paragraph5">It’s easy to see just how important English is around the world. Many international
                businesses conduct meetings in English, universities teach courses in English and, around the world,
                tourists and travellers use English as a common language.

                But how did English become so important? Well, it all goes back to the British Empire, which at its peak
                covered 25% of the earth’s surface. During colonial times, British rulers often obliged the people in
                those countries to speak English rather than their native language. Although the origins of English as a
                global language has a complicated past, the language has left an important mark on media, trade and
                business. If you’re still not sure about whether to learn the language, then check out the chart below,
                it shows the most spoken languages aroung the world</p>
