                <li>  Landscape Architect: Designing outdoor landscapes,including infrastructure, public areas, agriculture and forestry is
                    vital for constructing the webs that bind our urban and rural spaces, but also, and perhaps more
                    importantly, itâ€™s essential for responding to globalization and climate change.
                <li> Urban Planner: As a result of a rapidly growing percentage
                    of our population moving into urban areas, the conditions of urbanism are constantly in a state of flux.
                <li> Lighting Architect: Light has a profound impact on our
                    mental and physical health, as anyone living at high latitudes can empathize with.
                    Delving into the architecture of lighting entails improving the quality of our experiences, our health and
                    well-being, and the sustainability of not only the natural environment,
                    but also smaller spaces such as our work environments.
