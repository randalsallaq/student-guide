            <p class="paragraph">You must have been impressed by many spectacular construction works like the Duomo di
                Milano cathedral or maybe contemporary
                buildings such as Heydar Alive center of Baku. Indeed it's a breathtaking works that were
                accomplished in the grace of a perfect art and science mix. It's the studying of how forms and
                structures can express the building. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving
                architectural achievements.
                Architecture develops over time, adopting to humans needs and thier cultural diversity.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">The functionaliy of the building may shape up the design process.
                According to the Roman architect Vitruvius a good building should satisfy the three principles of
                firmitas,
                utilitas, venustas which translates to: <br>
                <strong>Durability:</strong> a building should stand up robustly and remain in good condition. <br>
                <strong>Utility: </strong>it should be suitable for the purposes for which it is used. <br>
                <strong>Beauty: </strong>it should be aesthetically pleasing.</p>

            you need to come up with neat ideas. Daily tasks also combine working with drawing and BIM (building information modeling) software and he occassionally do site visits.
            If you find you have imaginary and conceptual visions then go for it.</p>
