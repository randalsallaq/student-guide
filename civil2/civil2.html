        <p class="paragraph"> Civil engineers are responsible for the basic needs and facilities (or infrastructure) of modern society. They improve systems and processes that allow humans and nature to coexist with minimal impact. Modern society could not function without them. We need civil engineers to design and build higher-capacity transportation systems. We need them to construct larger commercial and industrial complexes.

        <h1 id="headingTwo"> Why Study Civil engineering?</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Civil engineers are becoming more and more important with time. Now, they are also responsible for looking after the fire control systems and installing quick fire exit points in the buildings they design. This will help in minimizing the loss of life during fire accidents.

            <h2> Did you know?</h2>
            <p id="didYouKnow"> Civil engineering has been around for centuries: “Engineer” and “architect” used to be synonymous, up until the 19th It wasn’t until 1828 that the term “civil engineering” was used to describe building projects made by a non-military group.

        <p class="paragraph" style=" width: 60%;          ">
            <b > Leadership skills:</b> Civil engineers take ultimate responsibility for the projects that they manage or research that they perform. 

            <b > Math skills: </b> Civil engineers use the principles of calculus, trigonometry, and other advanced topics in mathematics for analysis, design, and troubleshooting in their work.  

            <b > Organizational skills:  </b> Only licensed civil engineers can sign the design documents for infrastructure projects. This requirement makes it imperative that civil engineers be able to monitor and evaluate the work at the jobsite as a project progresses. That way, they can ensure compliance with the design documents. 
            
            <b > Problem-solving skills:  </b>Civil engineers work at the highest level of the planning, design, construction, and operation of multifaceted projects or research.
