            Milano cathedral or maybe contemporary
            buildings such as Heydar Alive center of Baku. Architecture is the studying of how forms and
            structures convey the building. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving
            architectural achievements.
            Architecture develops over time, adopting to humans needs and thier cultural diversity.

                    <li> Landscape Architect: Designing outdoor landscapes,including infrastructure, public areas,
                        agriculture and forestry is
                        vital for constructing the webs that bind our urban and rural spaces, but also, and perhaps more
                        importantly, itâ€™s essential for responding to globalization and climate change.
                    <li> Urban Planner: As a result of a rapidly growing percentage
                        of our population moving into urban areas, the conditions of urbanism are constantly in a state
                        of flux.
                    <li> Lighting Architect: Light has a profound impact on our
                        mental and physical health, as anyone living at high latitudes can empathize with.
                        Delving into the architecture of lighting entails improving the quality of our experiences, our
                        health and
                        well-being, and the sustainability of not only the natural environment,
                        but also smaller spaces such as our work environments.
