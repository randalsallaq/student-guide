        <p class="paragraph"> Software engineering is a detailed study of engineering to the design,
            development and maintenance of software.
            Software engineering was introduced to address the issues of low-quality software projects.
            Problems arise when a software generally exceeds timelines, budgets, and reduced levels of
            quality
            <br>
            Software Engineering applies the knowledge and theoretical understanding gained through
            computer science to building high-quality software products. As a maturing discipline,
            software is becoming more and more important in our everyday lives.
            Our software development and engineering professional program is Pace University‚Äôs response
            to the tremendous growth of the software development industry.</p>

        <h1 id="headingTwo"> Why Study Software Engineering?</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">
            There is a growing need for talented software developers across every industry.
            As technology advances, the ability to build quality software while considering design,
            development, security,
            and maintenance is sought after amongst all kinds of companies, from finance and banking to
            healthcare and national security.
            <br>
            <br>
            According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics‚Äô Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2014-15 Edition,
            ‚Äúsoftware engineers are among the occupations projected to grow the fastest and add the most new
            jobs over the 2012-2022 decade, resulting in excellent job prospects.‚Äù

                According to CareerCast, the job of software engineer was ranked as the most valuable job in the world,
                and the highest paid job in America with an average salary of $100,690 üòé
                üíª differences:
                The difference between programming and software engineering is that programming is the writing of the
                source code of the program, and therefore is part of the design phase in software engineering that
                builds the software system as an integrated project. üòä
