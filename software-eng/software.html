            <p class="paragraph"> Software engineering is a detailed study of engineering to the design,
                development and maintenance of software.
                Software engineering was introduced to address the issues of low-quality software projects.
                Problems arise when a software generally exceeds timelines, budgets, and reduced levels of
                quality
                <br>
                Software Engineering applies the knowledge and theoretical understanding gained through
                computer science to building high-quality software products. As a maturing discipline,
                software is becoming more and more important in our everyday lives.

                to the tremendous growth of the software development industry.</p>

                According to CareerCast, the job of software engineer was ranked as the most valuable job in the world,
                and the highest paid job in America with an average salary of $100,690 üòé

                üíª differences:
                The difference between programming and software engineering is that programming is the writing of the
                source code of the program, and therefore is part of the design phase in software engineering that
                builds the software system as an integrated project. üòä

                <strong> Mathematics :</strong> (IT specialties in general is necessary the owner is in <br>
                love/good in mathematics because it is based on mathematics). <br>
                <strong> Engineering </strong> <br> <br>
                <strong> Manufacturing: </strong> Software is a set of steps. Each step is precisely defined and
                implemented. Like many industries, to improve and develop production lines and reach the required
                quality level. <br><br>

                <strong> Project Management: </strong> Whether commercial or non-commercial, it needs management.

                There is a growing need for talented software developers across every industry.
                As technology advances, the ability to build quality software while considering design,
                development, security,
                and maintenance is sought after amongst all kinds of companies, from finance and banking to
                healthcare and national security.

                Software engineers apply the principles of software engineering to the design, development, maintenance,
                testing, and evaluation of software. There is much discussion about the degree of education and or
                certification that should be required for software engineers.
                <br><br>
                According to StackOverflow Survey 2018, software engineers are lifelong learners; almost 90% of all
                developers say they have taught themselves a new language, framework, or tool outside of their formal
                education.
            <p class="paragraph">

                Software engineering almost always includes a vast amount of teamwork. Designers, writers, coders,
                testers, various team members, and the entire IT team need to understand the code.

                Software engineers should understand how to work with several common computer languages, including
                Visual Basic, Python, Java, C, and C++. According to Stackoverflow, for the sixth year in a row,
                JavaScript is the most commonly used programming language. Python has risen in the ranks, surpassing C#
                this year, much like it surpassed PHP last year. Python has a solid claim to being the fastest-growing
                major programming language.

            <h1 id="heading6" > what is the Future of Software  Engineering?</h1>
                <p class="paragraph">
            Software engineers are important and really the main importance of software engineering is that the build
            something that wasn‚Äôt there before. This is a unique field because they walk the fine line between creative
            and scientific. They need to be able to visualize the product and then create it. How you approach software
            engineering is an important part of how your engineers will work ‚Äì do you want to develop software for the
            needs of the users? Do you want to develop software that runs devices and controls your networks? Do you
            want software that does a combination of the two?

            Into the future, there may be even more options and those that invest in software engineering now will reap
            the benefits for years to come.
