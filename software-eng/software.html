            <p class="paragraph"> Software engineering is a detailed study of engineering to the design,
                development and maintenance of software.
                Software engineering was introduced to address the issues of low-quality software projects.
                Problems arise when a software generally exceeds timelines, budgets, and reduced levels of
                quality
                <br>
                Software Engineering applies the knowledge and theoretical understanding gained through
                computer science to building high-quality software products. As a maturing discipline,
                software is becoming more and more important in our everyday lives.

                to the tremendous growth of the software development industry.</p>

                According to CareerCast, the job of software engineer was ranked as the most valuable job in the world,
                and the highest paid job in America with an average salary of $100,690 üòé

                üíª differences:
                The difference between programming and software engineering is that programming is the writing of the
                source code of the program, and therefore is part of the design phase in software engineering that
                builds the software system as an integrated project. üòä
