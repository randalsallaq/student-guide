                            Civil Engineering is one of the most popular and old branches which is all about the
                            planning,
                            construction
                            and maintenance of man-made structures such as buildings, roads, bridges, tunnels, canals
                            and dams.
                            <br>
                            Civil engineering is the application of physical and scientific principles for solving the
                            problems
                            of society, and its history is intricately linked to advances in the understanding of
                            physics and
                            mathematics throughout history. Because civil engineering is a broad profession, including
                            several
                            specialized sub-disciplines, its history is linked to knowledge of structures, materials
                            science,
                            geography, geology, soils, hydrology, environmental science, mechanics, project management,
                            and
                            other fields.

                        Working in an exciting environment: by studying civil engineering, you are involved in the
                        entire
                        product development process. From the beginning of the projectâ€™s design, to bringing it to life
                        and
                        maintaining it
                        <br>

                        There are many many buildings, skyscrapers and bridges. In addition to that there are wonderful
                        airports, massive dams, long tunnels and large artificial islands created by intelligent Civil
                        engineers. When you see them, you feel like you don't want to just see them rather you want to
                        build
                        them. That's only possible when you're a CIVIL ENGINEER.

                        <br>
                        Most Civil Engineering courses include the option for an industry placement during the degree.
                        You
                        may even get paid for the work you do. Furthermore, a lot of undergraduate courses can include a
                        master's year, and postgraduate options are in abundance.

                        <br>
                        The subject area is very diverse, as you'll learn valuable transferable skills that can be
                        employed
                        to numerous professions. This includes problem solving, decision making and analysing.

                        Civil Engineering degrees produce supply for increasing demand. There's a growing need for those
                        who
                        can design and build the structures that allow modern life to happen.

                        <br>
                        Particular job areas include building surveyor, consultant, contract worker, site engineer,
                        structural engineer, geologist, and quantity surveyor.
                        <br>
                        Several professional organisations offer specialised positions for Civil Engineering graduates,
                        such as BAE.

                        If you want to be a civil engineer it's
                        good if your subjects include English, maths and sciences. But these subjects are also useful:

                        Civil engineers usually work in teams so if you like group work or team sports that will help.

                        If you can understand or speak a language then that can be very useful as civil engineering is a
