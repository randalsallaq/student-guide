                    Civil Engineering is one of the most popular and old branches which is all about the planning,
                    construction
                    and maintenance of man-made structures such as buildings, roads, bridges, tunnels, canals and dams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Civil engineering is the application of physical and scientific principles for solving the problems
                    of society, and its history is intricately linked to advances in the understanding of physics and
                    mathematics throughout history. Because civil engineering is a broad profession, including several
                    specialized sub-disciplines, its history is linked to knowledge of structures, materials science,
                    geography, geology, soils, hydrology, environmental science, mechanics, project management, and
                    other fields.

                    Working in an exciting environment: by studying civil engineering, you are involved in the entire
                    product development process. From the beginning of the projectâ€™s design, to bringing it to life and
                    maintaining it
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many many buildings, skyscrapers and bridges. In addition to that there are wonderful
                    airports, massive dams, long tunnels and large artificial islands created by intelligent Civil
                    engineers. When you see them, you feel like you don't want to just see them rather you want to build
                    them. That's only possible when you're a CIVIL ENGINEER.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most Civil Engineering courses include the option for an industry placement during the degree. You
                    may even get paid for the work you do. Furthermore, a lot of undergraduate courses can include a
                    master's year, and postgraduate options are in abundance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The subject area is very diverse, as you'll learn valuable transferable skills that can be employed
                    to numerous professions. This includes problem solving, decision making and analysing.
